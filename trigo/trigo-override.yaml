# standard settings for trigo openshift vault.
# our standard setup includes: tls being enabled (default would be disabled) and openshift set to true (default would be vanilla kubernetes and therefore false)
# data storage set to 10GB and Audit log storage to 5GB per replica for 3 replicas using "raft" as replicated storage backend in a high availability setup.
# the config settings are directly applied to the vault server settings and allow for the secondary vault on our VM to perform a auto unseal action when the vault pods get restarted
# the agent injector will be disabled as secrets should get to the pods in the form of external secrets
